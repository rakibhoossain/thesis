\section{Conclusion}
This thesis began with a simple question: \textit{Can computers understand the emotions in Bengali news?} The answer, as I discovered, is \textbf{Yes, but with caveats.}

\section{What Was Achieved}
My primary contribution was not just training a model, but building the infrastructure for others to do so.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Breaking the Data Barrier:} I scraped and cleaned over 70,000 articles. This implies that future researchers won't have to start from scratch; they can start with my dataset.
    \item \textbf{Proving "Small is Big":} I showed that you don't need a massive supercomputer to do state-of-the-art NLP. By fine-tuning DistilBERT (a "small" model), I outperformed the Facebook giant XLM-RoBERTa by 20\%.
    \item \textbf{Making it Real:} I didn't stop at a Jupyter Notebook. The web app means a non-coder can actually use this tool today.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Honest Limitations}
It is important to be transparent about what the system \textit{cannot} do.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The "Teacher's Ceiling":} Since I used a pre-trained model to generate my labels, my model is essentially a student mimicking a teacher. The student can theoretically never be better than the teacher. A truly "Gold Standard" model would need human-verified labels.
    \item \textbf{The "Goldfish Memory":} The model reads each article in isolation. It doesn't know that "The Prime Minister" mentioned in Article B is the same person from Article A. It lacks long-term context.
\end{itemize}

\section{If I Had More Time (Future Work)}
Research is never finished, only submitted. If I were to continue this work, I would focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multimodal Analysis:} News isn't just text. Often, the photo tells the real story. I would love to build a model that looks at the image \textit{and} the headline together.
    \item \textbf{Explainability (XAI):} Right now, the model is a "Black Box." It says "Negative," but it doesn't tell us \textit{why}. Integrating tools like SHAP would allow us to see which words triggered the decision, building trust with users.
\end{itemize}

\section{Final Thoughts}
Bengali is spoken by 260 million people. It deserves AI tools that are just as good as those for English. This thesis is a small brick in that massive wall, but I hope it serves as a solid foundation for those who come after me.
